# esX 🧠💻

**A micro JavaScript framework** designed to help you build modular, controller-based web apps with simplicity and speed — no build tools, no fluff.

> Focus on logic, not boilerplate. `esX` handles the request wiring, posting, validation, and more — so you can just build.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧱 **Modular controller architecture** — Extend once, reuse everywhere
- ⚙️ **Auto-handled form submission** — `esXPosting` and `esXGetting` take care of it
- ✅ **Simple validation helpers** — Write your rules, let the controller handle the rest
- 🔌 **Pluggable design** — Drop in more controllers as your app grows
- 💡 **Zero dependencies** — Built with ECMAScript + vanilla JS
